# SGA-Project

This student fees project is the first created by Diamondback Lab, a new effort in the newsroom to combine journalism and computer science in our digital endeavors.

The project was done by Xiaoyu Yin, one of the original web developers on the team and overseen.

If you have questions about the project or want to build something similar, please contact onlineumdbk@gmail.com before using the code.
